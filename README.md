# EngD-project
This BIM-based circularity assessment tool (B-CAT) has been developed as part of an EngD project [1], which was co-sponsored by the Univeristy of Twente and DigiGo. The tool attempts to assess the level of circularity of a certain construction project (including renovation, new-built or demolished), by analyzing different materials flowing in/out of a construction site. It builds on the Circular Project model [2].
